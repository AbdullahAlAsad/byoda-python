# Bring your own data & algorithms

## Intro
This is the python implementation of the Byoda directory server and the pod. For more information about Byoda, please read the [wiki](https://github.com/StevenHessing/byoda/wiki)

## Status
The directory server is supporting the APIs for clients but not yet the APIs for services.
The pod is currently bootstrapping and running in a container in a public cloud but the APIs and the storage backend are still to be implemented.
